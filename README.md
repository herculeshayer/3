# 3 - E-Commerce Website 

First time building an e-commerce webpage, I feel with the technologies I've learned & apps I've built,
this will be a great project to undertake.

The project will essentially be an e-commerce website where users can purchase different types of trees. 
The name of the application is pronounced as if you're Brad Pitt from Snatch - three becomes tuh-ree - it sounds similar to tree.

Either way, this repository is a work in progress, and simply to learn and practice new technologies. I'll make updates to it as time goes on.


**Planned Tech Stack**
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- GraphQL
- TailwindCSS
- AWS or Heroku
